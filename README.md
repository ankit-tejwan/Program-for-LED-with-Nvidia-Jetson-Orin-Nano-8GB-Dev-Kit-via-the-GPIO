# Program for LED with Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano 8GB Dev Kit via the GPIO
Connection Setup up the hardware
First make sure we have the correct orientation.

Rotate the jetson until the RJ45 is facing down, and we can see the word Nvidia is on the left side.

Connect the ground (pin 6) to the negative of LED (shorter leg), indicated by the black wire.

Connect the pin7 to the positive of LED (longer leg), indicated by a white wire.

# How to program
sudo pip install Jetson.GPIO

# code in script.py

# Run script.py

#⚡ What comes out of your pin (Pin 7)
🔹 Voltage

When you set the pin HIGH in your script:
